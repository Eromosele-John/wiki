	<div class="intro">
	Welcome to HacksHackers Africa.  This collaborative wiki is meant to give you some basic guidelines for setting up and running your own local chapter of HacksHackers.
	<br/><br/>This is not a public website.  It is only accessible to chapter ExCos and organisers.  The wiki offers guidelines on how to recruit members, how to structure your chapter, how to build a page for your chapter on the African HacksHackers web portal, and how to qualify for a seed grant and monthly subsidies to run your chapter.
	<br/><br/>This wiki will grow as the African HacksHackers community expands.  We welcome suggestions for streamlining or improving procedures, and will respond immediately to requests for guidance on issues that have not yet been covered by the wiki.

	<div class="intro">
	We want a productive, happy and agile community that can welcome new ideas, improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between groups with very different needs, interests and skills. We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. 
	<br/><br/>
	This code of conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We expect it to be honored by everyone who is a part of the HacksHackers community.

          <div>
            Collaboration between teams that each have their own goal and vision is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each part must make an effort to understand the whole. Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. We prefer to work transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.

            Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them to persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction. We expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements constructively. When they cannot, we escalate the matter to structures with designated leaders to arbitrate and provide clarity and direction.

            Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.

            When somebody leaves or disengages from the community, we ask that they do so in a way that minimises disruption to the project. They should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.

	<h1 class="title">What Do We Do?</h1>
	<div class="line"></div>
	<div class="intro">
		Lots. Our mission is to be an ideas catalyst, spreading knowledge, information and ideas.
		<br/><br/>
		We are also a match-maker, with chapters bringing together technologists (seeking content) with content-creators (who are looking for technological platforms or solutions).
		<br/><br/>
		Local chapter activities typically include talks, workshops, hackdays, demo days (just to get to know each other), and pitching sessions. We also co-host regular weeklong dBootcamps focusing on hands-on training around coding or open data, and we convene regional Code4Democracy hackathons and DataLiberation scraperthons on a quarterly basis. In addition, we help develop project teams for the annual $1m/yr African News Innovation Challenge and its companion $1m/yr African Story Challenge fund. We are a lead partner in the Code4Africa open data movement, we help co-host the annual TechCamp and its sister OpenAfrica Summit, and we help channel news entrepreneurs into the network of j-Accelerator civic tech labs and their affiliated incubators.
		<br/><br/>
		Beyond being a catalyst and match-maker, HacksHackers Africa is a knowledge repository. We help find the tools, resources, and people to translate ideas into tangible projects. This includes developing tutorials, support communities, and toolkits, as well as helping to design courses or curricula where none exist.
		<br/><br/>

	<h1 class="title">What's Behind the Name?</h1>
	<div class="line"></div>
	<div class="intro">
		Journalists sometimes call themselves “hacks,” a tongue-in-cheek term for someone who can churn out words in any situation. Hackers use the digital equivalent of duct tape to whip out code. 
		<br/><br/>
		HacksHackers tries to bridge those two worlds. It’s for hackers exploring technologies to filter, visualize and distribute information in a narrative way, and for hacks who use technology to find and tell stories. HacksHackers is a digital community of people who seek to inspire each other, share information (and code) and collaborate to invent the future of media and journalism.
		<br/><br/>
		This network seeks to bring all these people together — so that we can all be more effective in making sense of our world.
		<br/><br/>
		We aim to help members find inspiration and think in new directions, bringing together potential collaborators for projects and new ventures.
		<br/><br/>
	</div>
	
	<h1 class="title">Who's Behind the Initiative?</h1>
	<div class="line"></div>
	<div class="intro">
		HacksHackers Africa is part of the wider global movement, but our African chapters differ from those in the US or elsewhere in a number of fundamental ways - primarily because the African chapters have adopted a more formal management model at chapter level, coupled with a formal continental umbrella network, to ensure good governance and to help secure the funding and resources that we need to be effective.
		<br/><br/>
		Another way that HacksHackers Africa differs from the wider global movement is that the African rollout of chapters is spearheaded by a single catalyst organisation, the African Media Initiative, with additional funding and material support from an alliance of other media development agencies. 
		<br/><br/>
		The key backers are:<br/><br/>
		<ul>
			<li>The <a href="http://www.africanmediainitiative.org/">African Media Initiative (AMI) </a>> provides each chapter with a seed grant to kickstart activities, followed by a 2yr subsidy to underwrite meetings, and a pan-African coordinator to help chapters, secure international speakers, and provide fundraising support.</li>
			<li>The <a href="http://www.icfj.org/">International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) </a> > provides two digital strategists as pan-African project champions, & helps us network with chapters elsewhere in the Global South, including synergies with HacksHackers chapters in Latin America and the Middle East.</li>
			<li>The <a href="http://www.mdlf.org/">Media Development Investment Fund (MDIF)</a> > helps HacksHackers projects or startups prepare their funding pitches and business plans and helps connect eligible teams with Venture Capital or other funding partners.</li>
			<li>The <a href="http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbi/">World Bank Institute (WBI) </a>> has seed-funded the AfricanCommons platform that drives our umbrella web portal, co-funds our dBootcamps, & helps develop resources and tools.</li>
